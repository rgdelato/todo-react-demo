# DO NOT USE THIS AS YOUR BOILERPLATE

Just a demo project to show off some of the latest-and-greatest tech in the React ecosystem.

## Stuff
+ Webpack 2
+ `create-react-app`'s presets for Babel and ESLint
+ `prettier` running as a Git pre-commit hook (via `husky`)
+ Routing with `react-router` v4
+ CSS-in-JS with `styled-components`
+ Normal CSS run through PostCSS's `autoprefixer`
+ Function-as-children pattern for separating data

## Notes
+ `prettier` is still in beta, and is still a little buggy
+ `styled-components` is still a little buggy and new API is still being added
+ `react-router` v4 is still in beta, but mostly pretty solid
+ ESLint errors don't prevent the commit for some reason?
